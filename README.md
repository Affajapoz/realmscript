realmscript
===========

An AHK (AutoHotKey) script for Realm of the Mad God

Note: To find lines that require (or advise) changing, search the realmscript.ahk file for ;;;;; (five consecutive semicolons), and modify those lines or areas as needed. Do not change other lines of the program unless experienced in AHK scripting.

Features:
* Right click sends shift+left click and resends left click if it was set when right clicking
* Ctrl+right click sends right click
* Ctrl+t, then shift+right click sets and teleports to anchor
* Several text send hotkeys
* Pause hotkey
* Tutorial and nexustutorial hotkeys
* Swap hotkeys (only works at standard resolution) [allows for slot selecting, see note above]
* Shift+scroll wheel scrolls chat log
* /tp is converted to /teleport
* Fixed interact key with ctrl+f enters portals and character select.
